# Biomis Blockchain

## Overview
Biomis is a decentralized blockchain network that binds digital identity and ownership to biometric verification. It introduces an advanced framework for trustless and sovereign access by eliminating the reliance on private keys or seed phrases. Each transaction and wallet operation is secured by biometric authentication, ensuring that control of assets cannot be separated from the rightful owner.

## Key Features
- **Biometric Identity Layer**  
  Wallets and transactions are authenticated directly through fingerprints, iris scans, or facial recognition, creating tamper-proof access.

- **Dual Consensus Mechanism**  
  Biomis operates on a hybrid consensus combining:
  - **Proof-of-Biometrics (PoB):** Validates identity through zero-knowledge biometric proofs.  
  - **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** Secures the network and incentivizes validators for block production.

- **Sovereign Ownership**  
  Assets and identities are inseparable, restoring true sovereignty to individuals without dependence on recoverable keys.

- **Zero-Knowledge Security**  
  Biometric data never leaves the device. Instead, zk-proofs are used to verify authentication on-chain without exposing raw biometric information.

## Why Biomis Matters
Traditional blockchains rely on seed phrases and private keys, which can be lost, stolen, or compromised. Biomis addresses these vulnerabilities by making identity itself the foundation of blockchain security. This approach strengthens both decentralization and trust, bridging the gap between human identity and digital sovereignty.

## Architecture
- **Device Layer:** Biometric data captured securely on personal devices.  
- **Biometric Layer:** Zero-knowledge proof generation and local encryption.  
- **Blockchain Layer:** Consensus and smart contract execution using PoB + PoS.  
- **Application Layer:** Wallets, dApps, and identity services interacting with Biomis.
